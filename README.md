============

You control a firefighter in a burning city. Unfortunately, all your conventional firefighting tools are gone and you must put out the fires using a little rain falling from the sky.

Jump from platform to platform to tilt the raindrops into the fire, and take care not to be burned. Be careful - the rain will stop soon, and your city is relying on you!

(Now with 2-player and boss modes)
